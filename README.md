# SimpleSlideshow

This is a simple slideshow system, to be used on screens which show images for events or for general information.

This is a very simple system for cases like in schools, universities, etc where you would like to show banners for
events primarily.

# Usage

Download or clone SimpleSlideshow from [here](https://github.com/ShadowMitia/SimpleSlideshow)

Put the images you want to show in a directory called `images` at the root of the project.

Ideally the `images` folder should be synchronised with a cloud service such as Dropbox, Google Driver, etc to easily update the banners to be shown remotely.

The file `example.py` shows an example script on how to use this project.

# Dependancies

- Python 3 and up supported. Should work under python 2 as well, but not fully tested.
- SSS: https://github.com/intllgnt/SSS by @intllgnt. Comes packaged for convenience.

# TODO
- add a way to control slideshow parameters (e.g. command line parameters)
- custom path for `images` directory, multiple input folders?
